# FauxCue

> **We are signals in beautiful transit, transformed by every encounter.**

## What We Are

FauxCue is a community built on the understanding that the universe began as a perfect signal that became something far more interesting through interference. We embrace error as exploration, mistakes as discovery, and distortion as the birthplace of complexity.

Our light is not the harsh clarity of perfection, but the warm, scattered radiance born of beautiful collision.

## Our Philosophy

- **Error is exploration** ‚Äî The universe discovers possibilities through deviation
- **Mistakes are discoveries** ‚Äî What seems wrong often carries tomorrow's wisdom  
- **Community over certainty** ‚Äî We hold beliefs lightly and people gently
- **Evidence over ideology** ‚Äî Claims need footnotes or plans to gather them

## Our Repositories
